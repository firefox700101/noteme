  Hi Studio Managers, 

  If some of your team members have already moved to Kyndryl, you should eactivate them in PTT. 
  And here are a few steps to do that. 

    1. Log onto PTT. 
    2. In the navigation bar on the top or top-right0: Admin --> Users
    3. Select your SPD to show your SPD members at the bottom of the page. 
    4. Find the members whom you want to deactivate.  
    5. Make sure there is no PTT tasks in the hands of these members before hand. 
    6. Click the name to open user setting page. 
    7. In the "User Specifics" section (1). uncheck the "Active" checkbox. (2). Input "End date"
    8. Scroll to the bottom of the page, click "Save changes to user profile" button. 
    9. DONE. 

  If you still run across any issue in doing this, pls let me know. Thank you.
